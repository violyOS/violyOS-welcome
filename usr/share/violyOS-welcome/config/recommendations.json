		"description": "<strong>Snap</strong> is a new generation application packaging format developed by <em>Canonical</em>. Even though it was initially developed just for different Ubuntu platforms, currently it works in many other GNU/Linux distributions. It will help application developers to provide a unified package that can work on different platforms. By using snap package format, applications can have their own version of libraries and there is no need to worry about libraries installed in underlying operating system. Snap packages enable developers to bring much newer versions of apps to violyOS. Newer versions of KDE, GNOME, browsers or other desktop environment apps will usually build easily on older LTS releases but the complexities of packaging and providing updates have prevented us from delivering them in the past.",

Well, wonder not. Simply pop open a terminal and run the following command:</p> <div class=\"code\">$ snap find query</div> <p>The find command lets you quickly search for and discover snaps available to install from the command line. It can be run with a query after it (e.g., ‘snap find email‘, ‘snap find media’, ‘snap find messaging‘) or without.</p>  <p>When run without a query you’ll instead see a list of featured snaps.</p> <h3>See installed apps </h3> <p>Installed some Snaps but can’t remember what? Don’t panic. Use the list command to see an up-to-date list of all Snap apps installed on your system:</p> <div class=\"code\">$ snap list</div> <p>This list also shows you their version number, revision number and the name of the developer who uploaded it (handy when there are multiple versions of the same app in the store, e.g., Telegram).</p> <h3>Install & Remove Snap Apps</h3><p>If you’re used to managing software using apt you’ll instantly find the analogous snap commands easy to remember. You install snap apps with the ‘install’ command, and remove them using the ‘remove’ command.</p><div class=\"code\"> $ snap install appname </div><br/><div class=\"code\"> $ snap remove appname </div><h3>See details of an App</h3> <p>You can use this to see detailed information about any snap application, whether it is installed or not. This info includes the application’s release channel, confinement status, size, number of revisions, and more. The snap info --verbose offers a greater overview.<div class=\"code\">$ snap info appname</div></p> <h3>Update a Snap App</h3> <div class=\"code\">$ snap refresh</div> <p>Rather helpfully you probably won’t ever need to remember to install an update to a Snap app. This is because Snapd runs in the background and handles updates automatically (you can, ofc, revert a Snap update or install a specific revision).</p><a onclick=\"cmd('link?http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2016/12/simple-guide-snapd-commands');cmd('')\">Reference</a>"
