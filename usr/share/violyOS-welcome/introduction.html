            &zwnj;violyOS is a distribution (variation) of
            GNU/Linux. A dependable, secure, capable, and modern computer
            system that rivals all others in popularity and actual use.&zwnj;</p>
            <p>&zwnj;Unlike other operating systems, Linux is a major one used:&zwnj;</p>
            <ul>
              <li>&zwnj;on most of the world's fastest and most powerful
                supercomputers&zwnj;</li>
              <li>&zwnj;on many of (if not most of) the computers that make up the
                backbone of Internet&zwnj;</li>
              <li>&zwnj;and on corporate servers that require stability and
                reliability&zwnj;</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="wow fadeInUp">
            <p>&zwnj;violyOS is a stable, easy-to-use operating system
            focussed on security. It is ideal for
            those who want the most out of their computers and prefer a
            modern user interface. With modest hardware
            requirements, it is suitable for modern desktops and
            laptops alike.&zwnj;</p>

            <p>&zwnj;The operating system is more secure, and better
            supported than the operating system pre-installed on most
            home computer hardware today.&zwnj;</p>

            <p>&zwnj;Using violyOS provides you with the freedom to run a
            complete, full-featured operating system, pre-configured
            with most (if not all) of the applications you will need
            for your daily computing. Change anything about the
            way it looks, the way it works, or the applications it runs
            to suit your taste.&zwnj;</p>

            <ul>
              <li>&zwnj;Accessible to all, regardless of language and physical ability.&zwnj;</li>

              <li>&zwnj;A goal of ours it to make a rolling release modeled yet Stable Operating System that rivals Microsoft Windows, Apple macOS and Google Chrome OS.&zwnj;</li>
              <li>&zwnj;Software selection will favor functionality and stability over lightness and whimsy.&zwnj;</li>

              <p>&zwnj;What Linux, violyOS & The Cinnamon Desktop all have in common
              is they are Open Source. This software
              can be freely used, changed, and shared (in modified
              or unmodified form) by anyone. In a nutshell violyOS is
              free, in the truest sense of the word.&zwnj;</p>

              <p>&zwnj;Although you will find some distributions (variations) of
              Linux for purchase, the vast majority are provided free of
              charge, like violyOS. The distribution is licensed
              in a way that allows anyone to give it away for free, with no
              strings attached. For example, the licence gives any member
              of the user community the freedom to use Linux for any
              purpose, to distribute, modify, redistribute, or even sell
              the operating system. If you do modify and then
              redistribute Linux with your modifications, you are
              required by the licence to submit your modifications for
              possible inclusion into future versions. There is no
              guarantee that this will ever happen, but if you have made
              it better, then your changes just might be included in the
              next release of violyOS.&zwnj;</p>

              <p>&zwnj;Many of the users of Linux are corporations that
              use the operating system to run their businesses, or
              include it within their products. Many of these
              corporations provide fixes and new features for Linux as
              they use the software for their businesses.&zwnj; <a
              onclick="cmd('link?http://www.linuxfoundation.org/news-media/infographics/who-writes-linux-2015')">
              &zwnj;These improvements are given back&zwnj;</a>
              &zwnj;to the Linux community and violyOS improves as a result.
              This is how we can continually improve and grow without
              having to charge our users money.&zwnj;</p>

              <p>&zwnj;Unlike Windows and OS X, Linux is not created and
              supported by just one company. It is supported by Intel,
              Redhat, Linaro, Samsung, IBM, SUSE, Texas Instruments,
              Google, Canonical, Oracle, AMD, and Microsoft. Over 4,000
              developers contributed to Linux over the last 15 years.&zwnj;</p>

              <p>&zwnj;Whether you are a home user of violyOS, a
			  violyOS software or application developer, or an employee of
              an organization that uses the operating system, you are a
              member of the Linux and Open Source communities and benefit
              from the efforts of the developers who contribute to violyOS
              and its related projects: Linux and Arch Linux. Members of the community run Linux
              on almost any hardware, from the prettiest Macbook to the
              cheapest netbook, from the newest Chromebook to some very
              old machines designed for Windows, and from the most
              powerful Internet servers to the smallest smart
              thermostat.&zwnj;</p>
